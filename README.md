# Churn-prediction-with-Keras
This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets using Keras. 
It explores different model training strategies aligned with potential business objectives an enterprise might have to prevent customer churn. 
One advantage of using neural networks in this context is their ability to achieve higher recall and greater flexibility in optimizing 
loss functions compared to logistic regression. 
The dataset employed for training the model was sourced from: 
**[Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)**
